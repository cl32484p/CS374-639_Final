CS 639 Final Project

## The Targeted Problem 

The problem we aim to solve is the difficulty that students face in managing their meal plans and budgets while studying.A meal plan is essential to every studentâ€™s experience on campus.   Students often struggle to determine how much they should be spending on food per day, how many meals they can have per day at a certain price, and how long they have until the end of the semester. They may also miss out on food deals and discounts due to lack of awareness.This is an important problem because budgeting a meal plan can be practice for budgeting money later in life, where you have to know how much you can spend and how often you should be spending. Students should always have the best tools available to make it through the semester and having enough for breakfast or dinner at the end of the semester can make a great difference for anyone. This app aims to make it easier for students to manage their budgets and make informed decisions about their food choices. As we can see from the picture, below, that 54 percent of peole waste moeny on fast food.This also implies how significant this issue is.

Our vision is to empower students to make informed decisions about their food choices and budgets, leading to more financial stability and less stress.


## Why Us?
Our app is unique in that it specifically targets college students with meal plans and provides personalized recommendations on food expenses and available deals. It also offers tips and suggestions for budgeting and saving, which are not offered by other similar apps.

Some potential risks associated with the development of this app include:

Technical issues: There may be unforeseen technical issues that arise during the development process that could delay the launch of the app.

Lack of user adoption: While we believe there is a need for this app among college students, there is a risk that it may not be adopted by a large enough user base to be financially viable.

Budget constraints: Developing an app can be expensive, and there is a risk that we may not have enough funding to fully realize our vision for the app.
